### 🌟 CollegeTips Photo Gallery – Submission by Nancy Kumari

#### ✅ Tools Used:
- Tailwind CSS for stylish, responsive layout
- JavaScript + MixItUp for filtering
- Lightbox2 for fullscreen view
- HTML for structure

#### 🎨 Design Decisions:
- Fun color gradients and hover animations for a vibrant youth vibe
- Categories reflect CollegeTips personality: Team Vibes, Campaigns, Play Moments, and BTS
- Responsive grid ensures it works beautifully across mobile and desktop
- Interactive features (hover zoom, filtering, fullscreen view) enhance UX

#### ⚙️ Challenges Faced:
- Making filtering smooth while keeping animations light
- Ensuring mobile responsiveness for touch-friendly interactivity
- Finding and organizing visual assets (used placeholders for now)

#### 📦 Future Enhancements:
